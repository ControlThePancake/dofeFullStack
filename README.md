# dofeFullStack
#Disclaimer
This is a very much i'll wing it and try learn something new project so any help would be appreciated , and there probably will be alot of flaws but as long as it works i couldnt care less

Making a full stack website for DOFE silver. The website is gonna hopefully have an account system using OAuth, and some other stuff involving running bots on a server. The stack is very small only using Petite VUE, a fork of regular VUE, and Firebase DB. The hosting and other things will be managed by Firebase DB's cloud option. Although I might change my mind and host it locally using apache or something as I dont need this to handle large loads.
