This is a very much an "i'll wing it and try learn something new" project so any help would be appreciated , and there will probably be alot of flaws but as long as it works i couldnt care less

Making a full stack website for DOFE silver. The website is gonna hopefully have an account system using OAuth, and some other stuff involving running bots on a server, either a mongo db or a home server solution. I've changed the stack to a MERN stack, previously I was only going to use Petite VUE, a fork of regular VUE, and Firebase DB. The hosting and other things will be managed by mongoDB. Although I might change my mind and host it locally using apache or something as I dont need this to handle large loads.
