# dofeFullStack
Making a full stack website for DOFE silver. The website is gonna hopefully have an account system using OAuth, and some other stuff involving running bots on a server. The stack is very small only using Petite VUE, a fork of regular VUE, and Firebase DB. The hosting and other things will be managed by Firebase DB's cloud option.
